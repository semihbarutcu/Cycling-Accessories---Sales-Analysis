# Feature Engineering & EDA for Cycling Accessories Sales

In this project, I used 4 tables to analyze a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organization. I investigated datasets with using automatic Exploratory Data Analysis tools: dfsummary, autoEDA, visdat.

After I tried a couple of machine algorithms, I believe this data was created randomly and hard to regularize with any model. While I couldn't explore any meaningful relationship between variables, this project will be a good resource for me with EDA part.
